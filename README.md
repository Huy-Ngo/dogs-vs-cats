# Classifying dogs and cats images

In this project we build a convolutional neural network (CNN/convnet) to build a model to classify images of cats and dogs.

We use dataset [tongpython/cats-and-dog](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) from Kaggle.
This dataset is dedicated to public domain under [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
This dataset contains:

- 4000 training samples for cats
- 4000 training samples for dogs
- 1000 testing samples for cats
- 1000 testing samples for dogs

We move 1000 images from training sets of each class for validation.
